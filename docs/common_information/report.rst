    - Experimental Results (execution time and algorithm quality assessment), description of correctness verification
    - Conclusions from the Results
    - Conclusion
    - References
    - Appendix (include code, ensuring readability)

  - Text Quality

    - Meaningfulness
    - Coherence

- Comments

  - Failure to meet the requirements will result in a deduction of points.
  - The request will include points and comments regarding any requirement violations (if applicable).
  - The report will be checked only once, and the grade will be assigned based on the submitted version according to the requirements.
  - The report is reviewed online; the entire review process takes place in the request.
  - If a student falls into the **blue zone** for the task, the report points will also be nullified at the end of the semester.
    The report will be finally accepted and merged into the master branch only after both the **online** parts of the corresponding lab work are fully completed.
