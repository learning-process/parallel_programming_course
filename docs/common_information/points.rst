Performance points mapping
--------------------------

The ratio of efficiency percentage to points percentage (max 100%, min 0%):

If the score is not an integer, it is rounded up.

  +----------------+-------------------+
  | Efficiency (%) | Points percentage |
  +================+===================+
  | >= 50%         | 100%              |
  +----------------+-------------------+
  | [45, 50)       | 90%               |
  +----------------+-------------------+
  | [42, 45)       | 80%               |

Penalties
---------

- A deadline will be set for each version.
- 1 point is deducted from the version’s score for each day of delay.
- A task is considered submitted when it is merged into the default branch after a successful CI pipeline.
- The submission time is defined as the timestamp of the last successful CI commit.

Comments
--------

- It is forbidden to write the report if all tasks are not completed.
- One week before the end of the semester, the repository is closed for final assessment.
