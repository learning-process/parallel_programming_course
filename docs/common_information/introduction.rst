Introduction
============

Practice
~~~~~~~~

- We work online

  - Use GitHub repository
  - Use Pull Requests
  - Merge into the master branch
  - Test verification

- Task distribution is random for each student.
- Full automation of quality and performance checks; plagiarism checks are applied.
- Deadlines are set per task. See the penalties and grading rules in ``Points``.
- Examples are provided in ``tasks/example_threads`` and ``tasks/example_processes`` (and extended variations ``tasks/example_processes_2`` / ``tasks/example_processes_3``).
- In each repository, the README.md contains a link to the course documentation.
- Each repository includes an example of a properly formatted PULL REQUEST.
- Submission of all tasks is mandatory to pass the course.
- A task that has been merged into the master branch continues to be monitored.
  If a task fails in the master, it is disabled, and a record of this is added to the score table.
  All disabled tasks will result in a zero points result for those tasks at the end of the semester.
  It can be seen that your task is disabled due to the following reason: the directory of your task has been renamed
  from ``seq/nesterov_a_vector_sum`` to ``seq/nesterov_a_vector_sum_disabled``
