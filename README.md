# Parallel Programming Course

The following parallel programming technologies are considered in practice:
  * `MPI`
  * `OpenMP`
  * `TBB`
  * `std::thread`

## Rules for submissions
1. You are not supposed to trigger CI jobs by frequent updates of your pull request. First you should test you work locally with all the scripts (code style)
    * Respect others time and don't slow down the job queue
2. Carefully check if the program can hang

## 0. Download all submodules
  ```
  git submodule update --init --recursive
  ```
## 1. Set up your environment
### Static analysis of project
  * **Windows (MSVC)**:
  
  Unsupported operating system!
  
  * **Linux (`gcc` and `clang`)**:
  ```
  sudo apt install cppcheck
  ```
  * **MacOS (apple clang)**:
  ```
  brew install cppcheck
  ```

### Code style analysis
Please, follow [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

```
pip install cpplint # (Python3)
```

### Parallel programming technologies
### `MPI`
  * **Windows (MSVC)**:
  
  [Installers link.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=57467) You have to install `msmpisdk.msi` and `msmpisetup.exe`.
  
  * **Linux (`gcc` and `clang`)**:
  ```
  sudo apt install mpich
  sudo apt install openmpi-bin
  sudo apt install libopenmpi-dev
  ```
  * **MacOS (apple clang)**:
  ```
  brew install open-mpi
  ```

### `OpenMP`
  
  `OpenMP` is included into `gcc` and `msvc`, but some components should be installed additionally:
  
  * **Linux (`gcc` and `clang`)**:
  ```
  sudo apt install libomp-dev
  ```
  * **MacOS (apple clang)**: The system is completely unstable thus you are not recommended to use it with `OpenMP`!
  ```
  brew install libomp
  ```

### `TBB`
  * **Windows (`MSVC`)**: 
  
  `CMake` installs `TBB` while you run `cmake` for that project on Windows.
  
  * **Linux (`gcc` and `clang`)**:
  ```
  sudo apt-get install libtbb-dev
  ```
  * **MacOS (apple clang)**:
  ```
  brew install tbb
  ```

### `std::thread`
  * `std::thread` is included into STL libraries.

## 2. Build the project with `CMake`
Navigate to a source code folder.

1) Configure the build: `Makefile`, `.sln`, etc.

  ```
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake -D USE_SEQ=ON \
        -D USE_MPI=ON \
        -D USE_OMP=ON \
        -D USE_TBB=ON \
        -D USE_STD=ON \
        -D USE_STYLE_CHECKER=ON ..
  ```
*Help on CMake keys:*
- `-D USE_SEQ=ON` enable `Sequential` labs (based on OpenMP's CMakeLists.txt).
- `-D USE_MPI=ON` enable `MPI` labs.
- `-D USE_OMP=ON` enable `OpenMP` labs.
- `-D USE_TBB=ON` enable `TBB` labs.
- `-D USE_STD=ON` enable `std::thread` labs.
- `-D USE_STYLE_CHECKER=ON` enable style check with build project.

*A corresponding flag can be omitted if it's not needed.*

2) Build the project:
  ```
  cmake --build . --config RELEASE
  ```
3) Check the task
  * Run `<project's folder>/build/bin`

## 3. How to submit you work
* There are `task_1`, `task_2`, `task_3`, `task_4` folders in `modules` directory. There are 4 tasks for the semester. Move to a folder of your task. Make a directory named `<last name>_<first letter of name>_<short task name>`. Example: `task1/nesterov_a_vector_sum`.
* Go into the newly created folder and begin you work on the task. There must be only 4 files and 3 of them must be written by you:
  - `main.cpp` - google tests for the task. The number of tests must be 5 or greater.
  - `vector_sum.h`   - a header file with function prototypes, name it in the same way as `<short task name>`.
  - `vector_sum.cpp` - the task implementation, name it in the same way as `<short task name>`.
  - `CMakeLists.txt` - a file to configure your project. Examples for each configuration can be found in `test_tasks`.
* The number of directories will increase with time. To build only your project, you need to do the following:
  ```
  cmake --build . --target <name task's directory>_<name_technology> --config RELEASE
  ```
  Example:
  ```
  cmake --build . --target nesterov_a_vector_sum_mpi --config RELEASE
  ```
* Name your pull request in the following way:
  * for tasks:
  ```
  <Фамилия Имя>. Задача <Номер задачи>. Вариант <Номер варианта>. <Полное название задачи>.
  Нестеров Александр. Задача 1. Вариант 123. Сумма элементов вектора.
  ```
 
* Provide the full task definition in pull request's description.

  Example pull request is located in repo's pull requests.

* Work on your fork-repository. Keep your work on a separate branch and **NOT on `master`!!!**. Name you branch in the same way as your task's folder. To create a branch run:
  ```
  git checkout -b nesterov_a_vector_sum
  ```

*Failing to follow the rules makes the project build red.*
